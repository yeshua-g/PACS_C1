README is very detailed and all the instructions are clear.
Good use of GitHub.

You could have divided the methods defined in minimization.hpp into different header files, grouped by their purpose. For instance:
    - functions for std::vectors
    - OptimizationParameters struct + expressions evaluation and parameters reading from file
    - numerical methods
and then collect all the header files in an include foalder.

To avoid code duplication, you could have implemented functions to choose the step size update and check the convergence.
There is no need for defining new variables containing all the values of the attributes in the OptimizationParameters struct.
